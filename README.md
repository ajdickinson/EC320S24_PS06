# PS06

The following directory contains files for Problem Set 06 for EC320: Introduction to Econometerics Spring 2024 at the University of Oregon. You can find the main repository for the course [here](https://www.github.com/ajdickinson/EC320S24)


## Instructions

First, download the repository by downloading the zip file from the green "Code" button. Unzip/extract the zip file. It is a good idea to do this in a directory dedicated to this class. An example of a file path to save this zip file in would be: `~/Documents/classes/EC320S24/problem_sets/`). Once unzipped, open the `EC320S24_PS06.Rproj` which will open RStudio.

Navigate to the `Files` tab in the bottom right panel of RStudio. You should see the following files:

```
.
├── EC320S24_PS05.Rproj
├── R
│   ├── PS06.Rmd
├── README.md
└── data
    └── natality.csv

```

The assignment can be found in the `PS06.Rmd` file. 

### Data

The data used in this problem set contains information on a random sample of 36,051 births in the United States. Birth weight is commonly used as an indicator of infant health since it is very easily measured and widely reported. Also in the data are indicators for mother's and father's race, marital status, whether the mother smoked or drank alcohol during pregnancy and total gestation time of each pregnancy in weeks. See the codebook at the bottom for a description of each variable.

### Integrity

If you are suspected of cheating, you will receive a zero—for the assignment and possibly for the course. Cheating includes copying work from your classmates, from the internet, and from previous problem sets. You are encouraged to work with your peers, but everyone must submit their own solutions.
